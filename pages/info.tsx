        Our shirts, in an effort to reanimate second and third-hand goods, are
        often found in a less-than-perfect state. Because many of the shirts we
        use are on their second life, some imperfections in the fabric are to be
        expected. We print by hand, which also means the graphic itself is
        subject to variation; each product is unique. Please refer to the
        measurements provided on each product page for sizing.
